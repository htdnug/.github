### Meeting Information

Monthly meetings will be held at 6pm on the 2nd Thursday of every month. Meetings are free to attend.

Unless otherwise noted, the meeting agenda is as follows:
6:00 to 6:30 : Eat, Greet, and Open Discussion
6:30 to 8:00 : Topic Discussion and/or Presentation

The "Eat & Greet" has been established to allow members to grab a bite to eat, get settled in, mingle, etc. before we start the discussion for the evening. Food and drink is not provided unless otherwise noted on the meeting announcement.

The "Open Discussion" section will be general Q&A or discussion. This section of the meeting will allow members to tell us what topics they'd like covered, ask questions to their fellow members, etc.

The "Topic Discussion and/or Presentation" will be the bulk of the meeting and will change from month to month. We'd like to get some speakers but our group will focus on getting hands on with the technologies we're discussing.
